# myPortfolio_responsiveApp

This application is my portfolio website. In this application the user will be able to see the type of work I have done so far as a student at Mt Sierra College. You can see my Graphic Design work and the softwares that I used when creating my projects. I have also included a page where I present my Web Development (Front- End) skills and the computer languages that I used to create them. A contact form was also implemented into my site so that the user can send me a message to my email directly.
