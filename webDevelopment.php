				<p>
					Welcome! I am David, and I am beginning my senior year at Mt. Sierra College where I am persuing my Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design. What made me go down the road of a Graphic Designer was my love for drawing. I began drawing from a young age and this eventually evolved into becoming a hobby that I love to do. Now I want to use my passion for drawing in order to communicate with others visually through my work.
				</p>
				<p>
					My time at Mt. Sierra College has also introduced me to web design and computer programming. Ever since I got my hands wet in the design and programming fields, I have become increasingly attached to my work. I have a constant thirst to learn as much as I can about computer programming/web design.
